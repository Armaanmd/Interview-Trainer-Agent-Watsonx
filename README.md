# Interview Trainer Agent powered by Watsonx.ai

An AI-driven assistant designed to prepare users for job interviews with personalized questions, model answers, and actionable strategies.

## 1. Problem Statement

Many job seekers struggle to adequately prepare for diverse interview scenarios, often lacking personalized feedback or access to a wide range of relevant questions tailored to their specific role and experience level. Manually searching for appropriate interview materials is time-consuming and generic advice rarely builds true confidence. Our project addresses this by offering a highly personalized, AI-powered solution.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Our AI Interview Trainer Agent leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide a highly personalized interview preparation experience. It generates tailored question sets, offers detailed model answers, evaluates user responses in a Q&A session, and provides actionable improvement tips, all based on a comprehensive knowledge base.

## 3. Technology Used

This agent is built entirely on IBM Cloud's free-tier services, demonstrating powerful AI capabilities with accessible resources.
